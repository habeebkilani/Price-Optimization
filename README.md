# **Price Optimization Model for Retail**


### Welcome to the Price Optimization Model repository! This project aims to help businesses optimize their pricing strategies by using historical sales data and analyzing competitors' prices. The goal is to adjust prices dynamically to improve revenue and stay competitive.

## ***Overview***
### This repository contains a Python-based price optimization model, built to help retailers adjust their prices based on:
1. **Historical sales data:** Understand how your products have performed in the past.
2. **Competitor pricing:** Analyze competitors’ prices to ensure your pricing is competitive.
3. **Customer behavior:** Track how customers react to price changes, and predict future reactions.

## ***Key Features***
1. **Sales and Price Analysis:** The model analyzes sales and price data from your store and compares it with competitors.
2. **Price Elasticity:** It calculates how sensitive customers are to price changes (price elasticity). Some customers are very sensitive to price changes, while others are less affected.
3. **Dynamic Pricing:** Based on this analysis, the model suggests adjusting prices dynamically to maximize revenue while maintaining sales.


## ***How It Works***

### The pricing optimization process involves several steps. Here’s an easy-to-understand breakdown:
## **1. Load the Sales Data**
#### The model first imports your store’s sales data, including the prices at which products were sold, how many units were sold, and the corresponding competitors' prices. This data is used for analysis.

**What this means:** The model reads in all of your sales information, including data like product prices, sales amounts, and competitors' prices.

## **2. Visualize Price Distribution**
#### The model will plot the price distribution for both your store and competitors to give you a clear view of how your prices compare.
* **Left chart:** Your store's price distribution.
* **Right chart:** Competitor’s price distribution.

**What this means:** This helps you see how your prices stack up against competitors. For example, it shows whether your products are generally more affordable or more expensive.

## **3. Analyze Sales vs Price**
#### Next, the model shows the relationship between product price and sales. Scatter plots are used to see whether higher prices lead to higher or lower sales.

**What this means:** You can see how changes in product price affect sales volume. For example, a sharp drop in sales with a price increase might indicate that customers are sensitive to price changes for a particular product.

## **4. Calculate Price Elasticity**
#### Price elasticity helps you understand how much the quantity sold changes when the price changes.
* **High elasticity:** Customers are very sensitive to price changes (e.g., when the price increases, sales drop quickly).
* **Low elasticity:** Customers are less affected by price changes.

**What this means:** The model calculates how responsive your customers are to price changes. For example, if the elasticity is high, you might want to lower prices to avoid losing sales.

## **5. Dynamic Pricing Strategy**
#### Once the model understands price elasticity, it suggests dynamic pricing strategies:
* **For products with low price sensitivity (inelastic):** Slight price increases can boost revenue without losing too many customers.
* **For products with high price sensitivity (elastic):** You can lower prices to increase sales and avoid losing customers.
#### The model then simulates how adjusting prices could improve overall sales revenue.

## **6. Compare Existing Pricing vs Dynamic Pricing**
#### Finally, the model compares your current pricing strategy with a dynamic pricing strategy and shows the potential improvements.

**What this means:** By applying dynamic pricing, the model predicts significant improvements in sales and revenue without changing the number of units sold.


## ***Conclusion***
### This price optimization model provides insights into customer behavior and competitor pricing, allowing businesses to make informed pricing decisions that maximize revenue.

### By implementing dynamic pricing based on price elasticity, your business can:
* **Increase revenue.**
* **Stay competitive in the market.**
* **Better meet customer expectations.**
